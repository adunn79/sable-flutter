**Aeliana AI, LLC** ("we," "us," or "our") is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, and safeguard your information when you use the Aeliana AI mobile application (the "App") and our website `aeliana.ai`.

## 2. How We Use AI and Large Language Models (LLMs)

Aeliana employs advanced AI models (including GPT-4, Claude, Gemini, and others) to provide conversational capabilities.

- **Processing:** Your messages are processed by these models to generate responses.

- **Encryption:** We use industry-standard encryption (AES-256) for data at rest and TLS for data in transit.

## 4. Data Sharing

We do not sell your personal data. We may share data only in the following circumstances:

- **Service Providers:** With trusted third-party AI providers (e.g., OpenAI, Anthropic, Google) solely for the purpose of generating responses.
- **Legal Compliance:** If required by law or to protect our rights.

## 5. Your Rights

You have the right to:

- **Access:** View the data Aeliana has stored about you (via the "Knowledge Center").
- **Delete:** Request deletion of specific memories or your entire account.
- **Opt-Out:** Disable optional features like Location or Health integration at any time in Settings.
